### Summary
#### For this exercise, we have analyzed the performance of a number of high schools across various criteria. The analysis was to determine the top and bottom schools based on different criteria such as the size of the school, budget allocated to the school and the performance of their student's math and reading scores. We came to the following conlcusions.

### Conclusion
- Charter schools are achieving better results with a smaller budget, while district schools, which receive more funding, are not performing as well. We concluded this based on the fact that all of the top 5 performing schools are Charter where as all the bottom performing schools are District
- It was also observed that students are getting better grades in small or medium sized schools compared to the large sized schools
- Based on overall passing score, Cabrera High School is the top performing school while Rodriguez High School is ranked the last
